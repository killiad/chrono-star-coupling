This repository contains code for the purpose of coupling Project Chrono with STAR-CCM+ to model the running gear of a tracked vehicle.
This repository serves as a back up for the code in case something happens to my virtual machine.

NOTE: In order for this program to compile, copy the data folder from wherever you installed chrono. In data/vehicle/generic/driver, copy
Sample_Manuever.txt and rename the file to No_Manuever.txt. Then, in No_Manuever.txt, delete all lines exept the first row of all zeroes.

Compile this as you normally compile Chrono projects.
